# React.js Event Calendar Control

 Use a form to create events spanning multiple days and time. Upon form submission, the event is visible in the calendar and in the table below. Events can be viewed by day, edited, and deleted.

 # Current Support for Excel Files
 Excel files can be used to populate multiple events in one submission, but more robust and thorough support is needed.
 The data types and number of columns needs to be exact so that that calendar can visualize each row of Excel data as an event. Currently, upon submitting the Excel file, all rows will be displayed in tabular format.
 All text entered in columns need to be of tye Text, even for dates and times.
